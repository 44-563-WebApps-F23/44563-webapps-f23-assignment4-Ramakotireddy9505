    <b>NURSE.</b>
    <p>[doing so]</p>
    <p>But it is very much in want of mending.</p>

    <b>NORA.</b>
    <p>I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.</p>

    <b>NURSE.</b>
    <p>What an idea! It can easily be put in order—just a little patience.</p>

    <b>NORA.</b>
    <p>Yes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to come and help me with it.</p>

    <b>NURSE.</b>
    <p> What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold, ma’am,
        and make yourself ill.</p>

    <b>NORA.</b>
    <p> Well, worse than that might happen. How are the children?</p>

    <b>NURSE.</b>
    <p> The poor little souls are playing with their Christmas presents, but—</p>

    <b>NORA.</b>

    <b>NURSE.</b>
    <p> You see, they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them.</p>
